-- TODO

* in this code:
	.workLen = $fd
	.tempLoopVal = $ff
	.workLen should be 16 bits, and .tempLoopVal is not referenced by label, but its memory is used as part of .workLen+1
	So tidy up the code and make sure the ambiguity is resolved and the correct 16 bit size is reserved for workLen




* Strange case where with -c64mr when the ending address is not aligned to a page the decompression end check is not triggering correctly.
	* .smRLEByte is correctly encountered, however it looks like the last RLE for the last byte if it's not page aligned is one too many?
	* Maybe a problem in the output data?



* Implement -c64mrb as -c64mr works




* No need for this code in C64\Decompression\DecompressRLE.a
		jsr RNXPCompressionDecompress_GetByte
		clc
		adc RNXPCompressionDecompress_WriteByte+1
		sta .smEndTestL+1
		jsr RNXPCompressionDecompress_GetByte
		adc RNXPCompressionDecompress_WriteByte+2
		sta .smEndTestH+1
	The values can be pre-calculated and just stored by the self extracting code
