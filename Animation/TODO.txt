RawFrames7 has 128 frames
But the frames are too big to fit inside 64K of memory.
Using LZLMpi to compress each *.sch file also produces too much data.

So consider:
1) Using a static screen layout of 16x16 chars in the screen conversion and producing character data to fit that static screen instead.
Then delta compressing just the char data and displaying the static 16x16 char screen.
This means the decompressed char data should not end at $ffff. This means the screen data is going to have to be lower down in memory, probably around $c000 instead.
The delta frames can be arranged around this.

2) If the above option still prodcues too much delta data then use LZMPi on just the char data instead.
See if thsta works
Compressing sch data: 107,326 bytes
Compressing just char data: 79,764 bytes


3) If not then start adding some lossy encoding to the delta compressor. Make it possible to insert key frames especially for the end frame loop.
