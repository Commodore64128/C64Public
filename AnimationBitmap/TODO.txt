* .notSpecialEscape could actually be one 0, not two 0 since the first 0 is impossible as an escape due to the bmi/bpl being used


* Try to vertically center the outro video without killing memory



* Try various compression options for CharPack on a per frame basis
	This means the DeltaCompression tool will drive conversion of input BMPs via CharPack and cycle through the various options.
	For example try combinations of:
		* -forceordering -reducebitmapchange t.scr t.col




* Or create a decision point list, and iterate over the decision points until the more optimal dictionary choice is used?




* I really need to put a frame counter display in there that shows the time and number of frames displayed when it loops at the end :smile:
	and then calculate the average FPS



* Add an option to become increasingly lossy for compression...
