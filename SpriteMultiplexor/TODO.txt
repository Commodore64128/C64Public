* It should be possible to have other tables (don't use a bitfield, it's slower to extract) to contain multicolour enable and X/Y expansion flags and sprite background priority.
	The calculation involving Multiplex_spriteHeightTweak will need to be tweaked for Y expanded sprites.
	Make the code beneath "lda Multiplex_XPosHi,y" generic and able to optionally update the other bitfields for x/y expansion, multicolour and background priority.
	The code after ".over	sta VIC2SpriteXMSB" would need updating to also include any extra bitfield flags for x/y expansion, multicolour and background priority.



* MACROMultiplex_SpriteChunk might be more optimal if the MSB and potentially other flags are not calculated all at the same time.



* For very busy sprite displays have a mode where sprites are automatically alternated between frames to display as many of them as possible.
	Potentially useful for shooters and explosion effects. Flag certain sprites as being allowed to do this or not.
