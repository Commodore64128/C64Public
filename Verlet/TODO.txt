Looks like the C64 will need some 16 or 24 bit multiplies with 32 or 48 bit results accumulated. Urghh.


Then produce some C64 code by using the simple maths Windows test code.
The 16 bit / 8 bit divide can use a table since the maximum divisor is probably only going to a maximum of 32 or some such value and will fit in memory.
Probably use sprites and animated cubes using atan to find the angle.
