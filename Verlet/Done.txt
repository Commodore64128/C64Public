Things done...

Prototype some very simple verlet code.
To start with probably do some very simple Windows GUI application drawing lines.
Probably use the basic TestDraw example code as a framework.
This would also potentially allow me to create animation data for a quick C64 lines/sprites demo.
*But I really want to make the C64 demo realtime not an animation.
*So only really use the Windows application to check maths ranges and maybe some integer code that would be translated to the C64.


Swigning rope test works well.



For the ConstraintQuad the point to line test works not too badly.
However it doesn't cope well then an edge moves into a corner where the edge verts do not enter the corner.
Perhaps some circles, one for the center and one smaller one for each of the corners, would would better?
Then it would be possible to move the offending vert (or quad verts (center point)) out of the offending circle instead.
*Make ConstraintRadius use the circles method, it gets both quads passed in


Fixed the point in quad constraint so it moves points more realistically out of the quad.
The edge test was wrong.


Quad test, with eight quads, works well now.
