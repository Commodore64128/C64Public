; MPi: TODO: The main displayed area needs to mirror the first line of the score panel to improve the split.
;		Can then move the multi-colour panel split change to inside the bitmap+ECM area and not have the FLD flickering bug


; Stablised the score panel split for most cases. Sprites still cause some timing problems sometimes.


.hitSomethingTyped was sometimes getting a recently, within the same frame, removed AnimationType of $ff from an enemy bullet that hit the player with a player bullet nearby.
	This caused the recently removed enemy bullet to transform into a player dying animation.
	Now animation type is checked in the collision routine.



* Directional and directional hold animations are a lot better now.



; When Scroller_NeedFullColourScroll is not defined then look at splitting the char scroll onto two frames, use the now vacant colour scroll time.
; Can be done quite easily since they're split anyway.




* Add code to handle the slightly less memory hungry full colour per char mode in "ExternalTools\CharPad 2.0 310715\Examples (CTM5)\Examples - Rips\Turrican 2 - 4x4\Turrican 2 L2-2.ctm"
	Instead of a duplicate set of block data that contains colorus per block char cell, the colour mapping is on a per character basis, so constant for each character, not inside each block.
	194 char's data at $14
	colour mapping is at $624 at $14 + (numMapUsedChars * 8)
	172 blocks at $14 + (numMapUsedChars * 8) + numMapUsedChars stride 2
	170x48 map at $14 + (numMapUsedChars * 8) + numMapUsedChars + (numMapUsedTiles*4*4*2) stride 2
	* Added CharColoursForEveryCharacter = 1
