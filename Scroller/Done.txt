; MPi: TODO: The main displayed area needs to mirror the first line of the score panel to improve the split.
;		Can then move the multi-colour panel split change to inside the bitmap+ECM area and not have the FLD flickering bug

.hitSomethingTyped was sometimes getting a recently, within the same frame, removed AnimationType of $ff from an enemy bullet that hit the player with a player bullet nearby.
	This caused the recently removed enemy bullet to transform into a player dying animation.
	Now animation type is checked in the collision routine.



* Directional and directional hold animations are a lot better now.
