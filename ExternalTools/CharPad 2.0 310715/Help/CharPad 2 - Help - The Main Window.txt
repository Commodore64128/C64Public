Notes:-

1. When exporting character set data, the output file will contain eight bytes for each character in your set.
   Each byte represents the pixels of one row of a character starting with the top one of the first character. 

2. When exporting character set attributes, the output file will contain one byte for each character in your set.
   Each byte stores the combined colour and material values for a character.
   The upper nybble stores the material (0-15), the lower nybble stores the colour(0-15).
   Nb. The colour nybbles will only be useful if your project uses the "Per Character" colouring method.

3. When importing tile set data from a raw binary file there is no means to determine the intended tile dimensions 
   or quantity, therefore the data from the selected file is simply loaded over the project's existing tile data.
   If you happen to know the tile dimensions, set them in the project before importing.

   The tile data in the file will be applied over the project's tile data starting with the top-left cell of tile 0
   and will run left-to-right, top-to-bottom for each tile. 

4. When exporting tile set data, the file will contain one byte for each character cell in each tile.
   The tile data in the file will start with the top-left cell of tile 0 and will run left-to-right, top-to-bottom
   for each tile.

5. When exporting tile set attributes, the file will contain one byte for each tile in the set.
   The lower nybble of each byte will contain a colour code (0-15) for each tile.
   Nb. This data will only be useful if your project uses the "Per Tile" colouring method.

6. When importing map data from a raw binary file there is no means to determine the intended map dimensions, therefore
   the data from the selected file is simply loaded over the project's existing map data.
   If you happen to know the map dimensions, set them in the project before importing.

7. When exporting map data, the file will contain one byte for each cell of the map.
   The map data in the file will start with the top-left cell of the map and will run left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
