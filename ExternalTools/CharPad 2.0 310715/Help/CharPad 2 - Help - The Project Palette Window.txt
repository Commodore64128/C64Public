The "Project Palette" window.



The project palette window allows you to adjust various project options as well as define 
the project's colour scheme and current pen selection.



Radiobutton Group : Pens:-

-Transparent : Normally used as a background (screen) colour, choose from all 16 colours.
-Char colour : The native colour value used to render a character (or tile). See notes.
-Multi-colour 1 : Only available if multi-colour mode is enabled, choose from all 16 colours.
-Multi-colour 2 : Only available if multi-colour mode is enabled, choose from all 16 colours.



Radiobutton Group : Character multi-colour mode:-

-Enabled : Any character using a char colour >7 will appear in multi-colour (4 colour) format.
-Disabled : Characters can only use high-resolution (2 colour) format. 



Radiobutton Group : Colouring method:-

-Global : All characters are rendered using the same char colour value.
-Per Tile : All characters used by a particular tile use the char colour assigned to that tile.
-Per Character : Each character may be assigned it's own char colour value.



Radiobutton Group : Tile system:-

-Enabled : The project can make use of a tile set, the map data refers to tiles.
-Disabled : The project cannot use a tile set, the map data refers to characters.



Notes:-

The first option in this window provides a choice between enabling or disabling character 
multi-colour mode, if enabled, the character set may use up to four colours in any character
that uses a char colour greater than 7 (yellow) in the colour palette with the restrictions 
that the character's horizontal resolution is halved and the actual char colour can only be 
one of the first 8 colours.

If multi-colour mode is disabled, characters can only use two colours, the transparent colour 
and the char colour which can be any of the possible 16.  

The second option in this window provides a choice between three different colouring methods, 
the chosen method dictates how a character's native colour is applied.

nb. on the Commodore 64, colour is not a property of characters, it is a property of the screen 
matrix cells in colour RAM and so a character's colour (and multi-colour status) will depend on
the value assigned to the screen position (in colour RAM) it is displayed in.
