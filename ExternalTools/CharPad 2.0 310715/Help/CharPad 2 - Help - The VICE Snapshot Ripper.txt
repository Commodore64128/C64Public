The VICE Snapshot Ripper.



The VICE snapshot ripper allows you to search for useable project data inside a VICE C64 emulator 
snapshot (.vsf) file.

Please note that accurate data ripping is a somewhat expert skill and novices attempting to rip data 
may find a game's character set and little else.   



Menu Items:-

-File 

  -Open VICE Snapshot : Brings up a file dialog where you can choose the snapshot (.vsf) file to load. 

  -Save RAM Dump : Brings up a file dialog where you can choose where to save a (raw binary) 64K RAM dump. 

  -Exit : Closes the tool.

-Options

  -Reset Configuration : Sets all controls to their default positions.  

  -Recall Previous Configuration : Sets all controls to the positions recorded by a previous use.



Address Specifiers:-

-Character Set : Use the scroll-bar to search for a character set.

                 Nb. a character set used by the C64 must sit on a 2K boundary, hence there
                 are only 32 possible locations in 64K. 

-Character Attributes : Use the scroll-bar (and offset control) to search for character attribute data.

                        Nb. character attribute data may exist literally anywhere in the 64K and may
                        not even be in a format useable by CharPad. 

                        Nb. character attribute searching is only available to projects using the 
                        per-char colouring method. 

-Tile Set : Use the scroll-bar (and offset control) to search for a tile set.

            Nb. tile set data may exist literally anywhere in the 64K and may not even be in a format
            useable by CharPad.

-Map : Use the scroll-bar (and offset control) to search for map data.

            Nb. map data may exist literally anywhere in the 64K and may not even be in a format
            useable by CharPad.



Map Dimension Controls:-

-Map Width : You can type a specific map width or scroll through all possibilities. 

-Map Height : You can type a specific map height or scroll through all possibilities. 



Tile Data Format : Choose from 8 (Z-Pattern) formats, left-right, top-bottom (LRTB) is the most common.

Map Data Format : Choose from 8 (Z-Pattern) formats, left-right, top-bottom (LRTB) is the most common.



Map Data Cipher : XOR - Choose a (byte) value with which to defeat an XOR (exclusive OR) cipher used on the map data.

Map Data Cipher : ROR - Choose a quantity with which to defeat a binary rotation cipher used on the map data (0-7).



Notes:-

-When the snapshot ripper is closed...
  
  ...The 64K memory is not cleared so you may return to it without having to reload the same snapshot file.
  ...The current configuration of the controls is automatically saved for recall.
