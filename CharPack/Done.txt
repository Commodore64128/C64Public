Add extra parameters to remap input C64 colours to other colours before conversion
-c64remap 9 11 : Would remap colour 9 to 11
-c64remap 9 11 -c64remap 15 12 : Would remap colour 9 to 11 then 15 to 12




Process C:\Work\C64\EdelinTales\Graphics\Knight\Walk_SE_01.bmp into sprites
..\EdelinTales\Graphics\Knight\Walk_SE_01.bmp 0 11 12
-s ..\EdelinTales\Graphics\Knight\Walk_SE_01.bmp 0 11 12 sprs.bin sprs.idx sprs.col

*Because sprites can choose hires/multicolour then the colour output could do with a hi-bit colour flag to signify multicolour mode



Add multicolour and hires bitmap screen conversion options.
Multicolour
Bit pair = %00: Pixel has Background Color.
Bit pair = %01: Pixel color is determined by bits #4-#7 of the corresponding screen byte in Screen RAM.
Bit pair = %10: Pixel color is determined by bits #0-#3 of the corresponding screen byte in Screen RAM.
Bit pair = %11: Pixel color is determined by the corresponding color byte in Color RAM.
Make it possible to convert large screens of data, either wide or high. Think about data orientation output in character strips.
