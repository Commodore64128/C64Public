* Add some extra sprite objects tied to road position
	EnemyCar.spd
	Think about defining a generic way to define these objects, from their single sprite to multi-sprite formations
	Especially with regards to road position, perspective step/size and any angled/twisted left/right versions that might be used
	* In progress: .gotASprite RoadObject_Sprite_Type_EnemyCar SpriteRoadTab



* Figure out why Multiplex_SortStore isn't working correctly, in a way that doesn't break all the other multiplexor code use



	
* Make the colourise asm files generic and pickup RoadsideObjectColourLookup dynamically, or set RoadsideObjectColourLookup in a global include





* The top screen IRQ and the last multiplexor IRQ need to set the correct flags so the next multiplexor copy can be triggered earlier
	The flag also needs to be reset in the mainline to avoid a potential early trigger




* With corners, or steering, the road side objects seem to be using positions that appear to be inside the road at some extremes?
	Check the hot spots
	* Add some form of roadside tweak, that basically adds extra offset as a fraction of the road width or perspective?
	* The hotspot offset seems to be always using sbc? Is this accounted for in the data?
		lda xbtl
		sec
		sbc xhot




* Could do with a tool to edit the in-memory road tables whilst Vice renders the roads





* TODO: Supporting raised roads, like bridges or ramps, the horizon index can be separated from the plot culling functionality.




* In addition to the left/right roadside objects, can also have an above road list as well.




* Fork in the road, left and right choice, can be done by rendering up to a limit of the middle section that advances towards the screen like the roadside objects
