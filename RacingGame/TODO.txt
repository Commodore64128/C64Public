* With corners, or steering, the road side objects seem to be using positions that appear to be inside the road at some extremes?
	Check the hot spots
	* Add some form of roadside tweak, that basically adds extra offset as a fraction of the road width or perspective?
	* The hotspot offset seems to be always using sbc? Is this accounted for in the data?

* Could do with a tool to edit the in-memory road tables whilst Vice renders the roads






* One of the hill and valley sections has a badly drawn smooth edge, it seems to skip the rendering completely






* Add multiplexor animation copy and sort


	
* Move TrackDraw_colours to speed code in the cartridge



* TODO: Supporting raised roads, like bridges or ramps, the horizon index can be separated from the plot culling functionality.



* Store the roadside objects differently. Optimise their storage based on a linear buffer.
	Tool can be used to extract all this information.



* In addition to the left/right roadside objects, can also have an above road list as well.



* Road split can be done by rendering up to a limit of the middle section that advances towards the screen like the roadside objects
