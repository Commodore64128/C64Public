* Created cart based minimal build project, using ProcessorPortDefault, with the multiplexor enabled


* For: *.S.* *.BA.* in C:\CCS64\MyOldE114Software\ProjectX
Use this to convert: C:\work\Tok64\Debug\Tok64.exe /6510+ /stomp /totxt <filename>

* Extract meaningful graphical data for:
	Sprites
	Charsets
	Characters
	Road side objects

* Extract meaningful road data and data generation routines


* Understand how the plot routines work, tidy up from original source or engineer new versions.



* TrackDraw.a tidy code
	* Make data offsets position independant
	* Make multi-screen bank capable
	* Update multiplexor bank config
	* Update the sprite cull to be just above the score panel
	* Add a bottom of screen IRQ above the score panel for the screen split
	* Add NMI for horizon, use the bottom of screen IRQ above the score panel for the timing




* TODO: While rendering from back to front, there is an track object optimisation (for jsr objsprint), where the ymax of the draw can be adjusted to be higher.
When a far road row is being drawn below the near horizon the ymax can be the near horizon (i.e. hill crest) position.
	From the column 38 index, i.e. at the start of the track draw, before the road row draw loop, set ymax to be the Y pos from the hill crest horizon index
	The ymax reset with the hill crest index can be the first thing in the new road row plot loop
		i.e. Then after the near horizon position is drawn the ymax is is set to be the screen height again.
	* TODO: Below mentioned ymax optimisation available here, set ymax to max height
	* Use Debug_ForceTrackStateRender=X to render a certain track type
