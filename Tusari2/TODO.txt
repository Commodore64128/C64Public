* Late jump, for a few frames after starting to fall, allow a jump.




* Boss PoC
	Added boss sprites and map placement
	Need some simple AI
		Jump with leg animation
		Throw rock




* Sword, press space to switch?




* Optionally unroll Scroller_ScrollSprites




* Full screen mode will need to tweak the sprite Y position screen edge detection to allow some top edge wraparound
	Tusari2\Animation.a Animation_UpdateTick
		Scroller_DiscardMinSpriteYPos


; TODO: If one fails to allocate then abort the creation
	Also if carry is returned during the init then perhaps don't clear the map trigger value?



* Some assert macros would be nice, would help find bugs earlier
	Can be disabled by defining a value
	To jump (jsr) to a standard screen, perhaps with optional message?
		The jsr can be used to read the message text
			Look for: .error and +MDebugBreak usage



* Hidden power-up block, turns into standable block when shot
	Releases power-ups



* Collectable coins/crystals?



* For the init and tick (AnimationTypes_tickLo etc) here is a possible optimisation where the type is multiplied by 3 and a linear block of memory consisting of "jmp $1234" is created instead
	Making it very quick to index into the array and call the function, especially if aligned to a page boundary.
	The test needs to update the scroller mapH/L/pixel scroll values using the correct internal routine from the Scroller source
